History and Background
========================

``scikit-spectra`` originally began at the George Washington University in an 
effort to develop exploratory visualization techniques with UVVis
data, particularly the output of fiberoptic/nanotechnology research. 

The decision to officialy package these nascent tools was made for the following 
reasons:
 
   1. To faciliate easier sharing and better organization between collaborators.
   2. To document the progress and functionalities of the toolset.
   3. To broadcast the toolkit to the community, and hopefully to merge with other Python spectroscopy packages.

In regard to the final point, ``scikit-spectra`` is not an attempt to be the de-facto spectroscopy
toolkit in Python; rather, it is a domain-specific wrapper for pandas.  It should be quite extensible
to other spectroscopy domains, where it may perform a supporting or ancillary role.  It is our 
hope that in the future, other internal GWU tools for fiber optics design and nanomaterial plasmonics,
combined with this package, may form the basis for a crude nano-optics Python package.

About the Author
================

I'm a PhD student at GWU (check me out on researchgate_, Linkedin_ or twitter_ (@hughesadam87))
and former Enthought intern. I work in biomolecule sensing and nanophotonics.  
Like any PhD student, my time is stretched across many projects.  As such,
the ``scikit-spectra`` source code may is messy in places, and a test suite has
yet to be developed.  Developing the iPython notebook tutorials 
alongside the code helped served as a basic regression test platform.

Acknowledgements
================
Thank you countless developers who have patiently answered hundreds of 
my questions on too many mailing lists and sites to list.

Thank you `Zhaowen Liu`_ for all of your help with this project, our 
other projects and for your unwaivering encouragement (and for the panda).
